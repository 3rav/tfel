# Introduction

`MFront` version 3.1 provides an interface for the `ANSYS` `Mechanical
 APDL` (`MAPDL`) finite element solver. This interface is fairly
 features complete:

- Isotropic and orthotropic materials are supported.
- Small and finite strain behaviours are supported.

It shall be pointed out that the `ANSYS` solvers has a long
history. In particular, the design choices made for the `USERMAT`
interface were meant to allow the users to easily write finite-strain
behaviours in rate-form.

`MFront` strives to provides behaviours that can be used "just-like"
other `USERMAT` subroutines, but 

## Limitations

The `USERMAT` subroutines has a number of shortcomings compared with
other interfaces:

- External state variables are *not* supported.
- Internal state variables can *not* be initialized to values
  different from zero.
- There is no standard way of defining the orthotropic axes for
  orthotropic behaviours.
- There is no way of controlling the increase/decrease of the time
  step.

The choice made to defined the orthotropic axes for orthotropic
behaviours is detailed below.

## Pitfalls

There are also cases of misuses of the generated libraries that can
*not* be prevented by `MFront`. The most important ones are the
following:

- The modelling hypothesis is not passed to the mechanical
  behaviours. As a consequence, there is not way of distinguishing
  between the plane strain hypothesis and the axisymmetrical
  hypothesis, which is mandatory for consistent orthotropic axes
  management. Therefore, the user has to explicitly call the
  implementation of the behaviour corresponding to the modelling
  hypothesis he wants to use, but there is not way to ensure the
  consistency of this choice and the choice of the modelling
  hypothesis make for the mechanical computation.
- Whether the computation takes into account finite strain
  transformation (non linear geometric effects according to the
  `ANSYS` wording) is not known to the behaviour, so some misuses of
  `MFront` behaviours can't be prevented. For example, small strain
  behaviours can be used in finite strain transformation using the
  build-in Jauman corotational framework, which is only valid for
  isotropic behaviours. Using this framework with orthotropic
  behaviours can't be prevented.
- The user must respect the order of definition of the material
  properties, some of them being implicitly defined by `MFront`. For
  example, we made the choice to pass the orthotropic axes as material
  properties. Those are automatically inserted at the beginning of the
  material properties list, after thermo-elastic properties, if the
  latter are requested. As a consequence, the number of material
  properties depends on the modelling hypothesis. The user is thus
  strongly advised to look at the input file example generated by
  `MFront` to have a consistent definition of the material properties.

## Current status

The `ansys` interface is still in its early stage of development.

# How the use `MFront` behaviours in `ANSYS`

When compiling mechanical behaviours with the `ansys` interface,
`MFront` generates:

- Shared libraries containing one implementation of the considered
  behaviours per supported modelling hypotheses.
- Examples of input files in the `ansys` directory.
- A copy of a generic `usermat.cpp` file for the `ANSYS` solver.

Those various files and their usage are now described.

## Notes

- The `MFront` libraries are only generated *once*, only the generic
  files needs to be recompiled at each run. This is very handy since
  compiling the `MFront` libraries can be time-consuming. Those
  libraries can be shared between computations and/or between users
  when placed in a shared folders.
- The fact that `MFront` generates one implementation per modelling
  hypothesis allows the distinction between the plane strain
  hypothesis and the axisymmetrical hypothesis. This is mandatory to
  consistently handle orthotropy.
- The name of the library can be changed by renaming it after the
  compilation or by using the `@Library` keyword.

### Note on libraries locations

As explained above, `MFront` libraries will be loaded at the runtime
time. This means that the libraries must be found by the dynamic
loader of the operating system.

#### Under Linux

Under Linux, the search path for dynamic libraries are specified using
the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable environment. This variable defines a
colon-separated set of directories where libraries should be searched
for first, before the standard set of directories.

Depending on the configuration of the system, the current directory
can be considered by default.

#### Under Windows

Under Windows, the dynamic libraries are searched:

- in the current directory
- in the directories listed in the `PATH` environment. This
  variable defines a semicolon-separated set of directories.

## Generated input files

Here is an extract of the generated input file for a `MFront`
behaviour named `Plasticitiy` for the plane strain modelling
hypothesis for the `ANSYS` solver:

~~~~{.pure}

/com, using the tbtemp an tbdata instructions.
/com, See the Ansys "USER Material Subroutine" guide for details.
/com, Declaration of state variables
tb,state,<mat_id>,,5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Compilation of the generic `usermat.cpp` file

The generic `usermat.cpp` file provided by `MFront` has the following
role:

- Reading a file called `mfront-usermat.dat` that has to be present in
  the current directory. This file relates an `ANSYS` material
  identifier to a `MFront` behaviour.
- Loading the shared library and the behaviours implementation
  generated by `MFront`.
- Calling the `MFront` behaviour.

### Relating material identifier and `MFront` behaviours

The `mfront-usermat.dat` file gives a list of commands aimed to
associate an `ANSYS` material identifier to a `MFront` behaviour. The
syntax used closely follows `ANSY` `APDL` syntax.

Only two commands are actually supported:

- `/com,` which is used to introduce a comment line.
- `tb,mfront` which is used to associate an `ANSYS` material
  identifier to a `MFront` behaviour.

Here is an example of such a file:

~~~~{.pure}
/com, Associate the material id 2 to the Chaboche_3D behaviour
/com, implemented in the Zircaloy4Behaviours shared library.
tb,mfront,2,Zircaloy4Behaviours,Chaboche_3D
/com, Associate the material id 3 to the Creep_3D behaviour
/com, implemented in the Zircaloy4Behaviours shared library.
tb,mfront,3,UO2Behaviours,Creep_3D
~~~~

New commands will eventually be introduced as needed to circumvent the
various shortcomings of the `USERMAT` interface, notably:

- Adding the ability to give initial values to state variables
- Adding the ability to override the default values of parameters.
- etc.

# Main features of the `ANSYS` interface

The `ANSYS` solver provides the `USERMAT` interface. In this case, the
behaviour shall compute:

- The evolution of the state variables.
- The value the Cauchy stress at the end of the time step.
- The consistent tangent operator. The definition of the consistent
  tangent operator is given below.

For finite strain analyses, small strain behaviours can be written in
rate form. The behaviour in integrated in the Jauman framework,
**which is only suitable for isotropic behaviours**.

## Supported behaviours

Isotropic and orthotropic behaviours are both supported.

Small and finite strain behaviours are supported.

## Modelling hypotheses

The following modelling hypotheses are supported:

- tridimensional (`3D`)
- plane strain (`pstrain`)
- plane stress (including shell elements) (`pstress`)
- axisymmetrical (`axis`)

The generalised plane strain hypothesis is currently *not* supported.

## Orthotropic behaviours

By nature, orthotropic behaviours are expressed in a preferential
frame defined by the material orthotropic axes. There is no standard
way of defining the orthotropic axes in `ANSYS`.

We choose to add the definition of those axes to the list of material
properties. \(2\) additional material properties are required in
\(2D\), and \(6\) additional material properties in \(3D\):

- In \(2D\), the two additional material properties are the two
  components of the vector defining the first axis of the material
  frame. This vector is thus supposed to be contained in the \(2D\)
  plane. The second axis is also assumed to be contained in this plane
  and perpendicular to the first one. With those assumptions, this
  vector can be deduced from the first one and does not have to be
  defined. The third direction is required to follow the out-of-plane
  direction.
- In \(3D\), the six additional material properties defines two
  vectors defining respectively the first and second axes of the
  material frame. The components of the first vectors are given before
  the components of the second vector. Those vectors are supposed to
  be orthogonal. The third vector, associated to the third axis, is
  implicitly given by the cross-product of the two first axes and does
  not have to be defined.

The user shall use the input file example generated by `MFront` to see
their relative positions of the material properties associated to the
definition of the orthotropic axes.

Those definitions are only meaningful if the direction of orthotropy
are constants.

## Finite strain strategies

Engineers are used to write behaviours based on an additive split of
strains, as usual in small strain behaviours. Different strategies
exist to:

- write finite strain behaviours that preserve this property.
- guarantee some desirable properties such as energetic consistency
  and objectivity.

Through the `@ANSYSFiniteStrainStrategy`, the user can select on of
various finite strain strategies supported by `MFront`, which are
described in this paragraph.

> **Note**
>
> The usage of the `@ANSYSFiniteStrainStrategy` keyword is mostly
> deprecated since `MFront 3.1`: see the `@StrainMeasure` keyword.

### The `Native` finite strain strategy

Among them is the `Native` finite strain strategy which relies on
build-in `ANSYS` facilities to integrate the behaviours written in
rate form. The `Native` finite strain strategy will use the Jauman
rate.

This strategy has some theoretical drawbacks (hypoelasticity,
restriction to isotropic behaviours, etc...) and is not portable from
one code to another.

### Recommended finite strain strategies

Two other finite strain strategies are available in `MFront` for the
`ansys` interface (see the `@ANSYSFiniteStrainStrategy` keyword):

- `FiniteRotationSmallStrain`: this finite strain strategy is fully
  described in @doghri_mechanics_2000,@edf_loi_2013
- `MieheApelLambrechtLogarithmicStrain`: this finite strain strategy
  is fully described in @miehe_anisotropic_2002 and
  @edf_modeles_2013. This finite strain strategy is yet to be
  implemented.

Those two strategies use lagrangian tensors, which automatically
ensures the objectivity of the behaviour.

Each of these two strategies define an energetic conjugate pair of
strain or stress tensors:

- For the `FiniteRotationSmallStrain` case, the strain tensor is the
  Green-Lagrange strain and the conjugated stress is the second
  Piola-Kirchhoff stress.
- For the `MieheApelLambrechtLogarithmicStrain`, the strain tensor is
  the langrangian Hencky strain tensor, i.e. the logarithm of the
  stretch tensor.

The first strategy is suited for reusing behaviours that were
identified under the small strain assumptions in a finite rotation
context. The usage of this behaviour is still limited to the small
strain assumptions.

The second strategy is particularly suited for metals, as
incompressible flows are characterized by a deviatoric logarithmic
strain tensor, which is the exact transposition of the property used
in small strain behaviours to handle plastic incompressibility. This
means that all valid consistutive equations for small strain
behaviours can be automatically reused in finite strain analysis. This
does *not* mean that a behaviour identified under the small strain
assumptions can be directly used in a finite strain analysis: the
identification would not be consistent.

Those two finite strain strategies are fairly portable and are
available (natively or via `MFront`) in `Cast3M`, `Code_Aster`,
`Europlexus`, `Abaqus/Standard` and `Abaqus/Explicit` and `Zebulon`,
etc...

## Consistent tangent operator for finite strain behaviours

The "ANSYS User Subroutines Reference Guide" gives indicates that the
tangent moduli required by `ANSYS` \(\CMJ\) is closely related to
\(\tenseurq{C}^{\tau\,J}\), the moduli associated to the Jauman rate
of the Kirchhoff stress :

\[
J\,\CMJ=\CtJ
\]

where \(J\) is the derterminant of the deformation gradient
\(\tns{F}\).

By definition, \(\CtJ\) satisfies:
\[
\overset{\circ}{\tenseur{\tau}}^{J}=\CtJ\,\colon\tenseur{D}
\]
where \(\tenseur{D}\) is the rate of deformation.

Most information reported here are extracted from the book of
Belytschko (@belytschko_nonlinear_2000).

## Relations between tangent operator

#### Relation with the moduli associated to the Truesdell rate of the Cauchy Stress $\CsT$

The moduli associated to the Truesdell rate of the Cauchy Stress
\(\CsT\) is related to \(\CtJ\) by the following relationship:

\[
\CtJ=J\,\left(\CsT+\tenseurq{C}^{\prime}\right)\quad\text{with}\quad\tenseurq{C}^{\prime}\colon\tenseur{D}=\tsigma\,.\,\tenseur{D}+\tenseur{D}\,.\,\tsigma
\]

Thus,

\[
\CMJ=\CsT+\tenseurq{C}^{\prime}
\]

#### Relation with the spatial moduli $\Cs$

The spatial moduli \(\Cs\) is associated to the Lie
derivative of the Kirchhoff stress \(\mathcal{L}\tenseur{\tau}\) ,
which is also called the convected rate or the Oldroyd rate:

\[
\mathcal{L}\tenseur{\tau}=\Cs\,\colon\,\tenseur{D}
\]

The spatial moduli is related to the moduli associated to Truesdell
rate of the Cauchy stress \(\CsT\):

\[
\CsT=J^{-1}\,\Cs
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
\CMJ = J^{-1}\Cs+\tenseurq{C}^{\prime} = J^{-1}\left(\Cs+\tenseurq{C}^{\prime\prime}\right)\quad\text{with}\quad\tenseurq{C}^{\prime\prime}\colon\tenseur{D}=\tenseur{\tau}\,.\,\tenseur{D}+\tenseur{D}\,.\,\tenseur{\tau}
\]

<!-- The relationship between \(CsJ\) and -->
<!-- \(\Cs\) can be expressed in component form as -->

<!-- \[ -->
<!-- CsJ_{ijlk}=\Cs+I_{ik}\tau_{jl}+I_{jl}\tau_{ik} -->
<!-- \] -->

<!-- where \tns{I} is the rank 2 identity tensor. -->

#### Relation with $\CSE$ 

The \(\CSE\) relates the rate of the second
Piola-Kirchhoff stress \(\tenseur{S}\) and the Green-Lagrange strain
rate \(\tenseur{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{GL}}\):

\[
\tenseur{\dot{S}}=\CSE\,\colon\,\tenseur{\dot{\varepsilon}}^{\mathrm{GL}}
\]

As the Lie derivative of the Kirchhoff stress
\(\mathcal{L}\tenseur{\tau}\) is the push-forward of the second
Piola-Kirchhoff stress rate \(\tenseur{\dot{S}}\) and the rate of
deformation \(\tenseur{D}\) is push-forward of the Green-Lagrange
strain rate \(\tenseur{\dot{\varepsilon}}^{\mathrm{GL}}\),
\(\Cs\) is the push-forward of
\(\CSE\):

\[
C^{c}_{ijkl}=F_{im}F_{jn}F_{kp}F_{lq}C^{\mathrm{SE}}_{mnpq}
\]

#### Link with $\deriv{\tsigma}{\tns{F}}$

For all variation of the deformation gradient \(\delta\,\tns{F}\), the
Jauman rate of the Kirchhoff stress satisfies:
\[
\CtJ\,\colon\delta\tenseur{D}=\delta\tenseur{\tau}-\delta\tns{W}.\tenseur{\tau}+\tenseur{\tau}.\delta\tns{W}
\]

with:

- \(\delta\tns{L}= \delta\tns{F}\,.\,\tns{F}^{-1}\)
- \(\delta\tns{W}= \Frac{1}{2}\left(\delta\tns{L}-\transpose{\delta\tns{L}}\right)\)
- \(\delta\tns{D}= \Frac{1}{2}\left(\delta\tns{L}+\transpose{\delta\tns{L}}\right)\)

Thus, the derivative of the Kirchhoff stress with respect to the
deformation gradient yields:
\[
\deriv{\tenseur{\tau}}{\tns{F}}=\CtJ\,.\,\deriv{\tenseur{D}}{\tns{F}}+\left(\tprd{\tau}-\tpld{\tau}\right)\,.\,\deriv{\tns{W}}{\tns{F}}
\]

with \(\delta\,\tenseur{D}=\deriv{\tenseur{D}}{\tns{F}}\,\colon\,\delta\,\tns{F}\) and \(\delta\,\tns{W}=\deriv{\tns{W}}{\tns{F}}\,\colon\,\delta\,\tns{F}\)

\[
\deriv{\tsigma}{\tns{F}}=\Frac{1}{J}\left(\deriv{\tenseur{\tau}}{\tns{F}}-\tsigma\,\otimes\,\deriv{J}{\tns{F}}\right)
\]

### Numerical approximation of \(\CMJ\)

Following @sun_numerical_2008, an numerical approximation of \(\CMJ\)
is given by:
\[
\CMJ_{ijkl}\approx\Frac{1}{J\,\varepsilon}\left(\tenseur{\tau}_{ij}\left(\tns{F}+\tns{\delta F}^{kl}\right)-\tenseur{\tau}_{ij}\left(\tns{F}\right)\right) \]

where the perturbation \(\tns{\delta F}^{kl}\) is given by:

\[
\tns{\delta F}^{kl}=\Frac{\varepsilon}{2}\left(\vec{e}_{k}\otimes\vec{e}_{l}+\vec{e}_{l}\otimes\vec{e}_{k}\right)\,.\,\tns{F}
\]

Such perturbation leads to the following rate of deformation:
\[
\delta\,\tenseur{D}=\left(\tns{\delta F}^{kl}\right)\,\tns{F}^{-1}=\Frac{\varepsilon}{2}\left(\vec{e}_{k}\otimes\vec{e}_{l}+\vec{e}_{l}\otimes\vec{e}_{k}\right)
\]

The spin rate \(\delta\,\tenseur{W}\) associated with
\(\tns{\delta F}^{kl}\) is null.

#### Relation with other moduli

The previous relation can be used to relate to other moduli. See the
section describing the isotropic case for details.
