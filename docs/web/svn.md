% Access to TFEL Subversion repository

% October 2, 2014

`TFEL` is developed using the
[`Apache Subversion`](https://subversion.apache.org/) open source
version control system. We do wish that many people get involved in
`TFEL/MFront` usage and development.


The `TFEL` repository is accessible at:
<https://svn-pleiades.cea.fr/SVN/TFEL>

This server is used for historical and practical reasons.

This server is not meant to receive a wide number of contributors, so
the access is currently restricted. Access can be granted to the
[PLEIADES project manger](mailto:vincent.marelle@cea.fr).

We may consider moving to another server if the number of contributors
grows significantly.
