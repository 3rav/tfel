# Tickets fixed

## Ticket #262:  Missing headers in packages generated by `automake`

For more details, see: <https://sourceforge.net/p/tfel/tickets/262/>

## Ticket #258: Missing `ndarray.cxx` source

For more details, see: <https://sourceforge.net/p/tfel/tickets/258/>

## Ticket #240: Ability to export the thermal expansion coefficients as material properties with the ‘cyrano’ interface

When the thermal expansion is handled by a behaviour, the thermal
expansion coefficients are now automatically exported as material
properties when compiling the behaviour behaviour with the `Cast3M` and
`Cyrano` interfaces.

The names of the functions associated with those thermal expansion
coefficients can be retrieved by:

- the `getUMATLinearThermalExpansionCoefficientsEntryPoints` method of
  the `ExternalLibraryManager` class.
- the `linear_thermal_expansion_coefficients_epts` data member of the
  `ExternalBehaviourData` class.
