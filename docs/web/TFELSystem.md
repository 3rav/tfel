% Using the `TFELSystem` library to retrieve metada about material properties and behaviours generated by `MFront`

The `TFELSystem` library provide several functionnalities to retrieve
metada about material properties and behaviours generated by `MFront`.
This functionnalities are also available in `python` thanks to the
`tfel.system` module.

Such functionnalities are helpful for creating tools interacting with
shared libraries generated by `MFront`. Examples of such tools are:

- [`MTest`](mtest.html)
- [`mfm`](mfm.html)
- [`tfel-plot`](https://github.com/thelfer/tfel-plot).
- [`tfel-editor`](https://github.com/thelfer/tfel-editor).

Those functionnalities are already used by several solvers to easily
integrate material properties and behaviours generated by `MFront`, such
as:

- [`Cyrano`](cyrano.html) (see @petry_advanced_2015)
- `Licos` (see @helfer_licos_2015)

> **Notes for propriary softwares**
>
> The `TFELSystem` library is released under the `GPL` licence.
> The [`MGIS` project](https://github.com/thelfer/MFontGenericInterfaceSupport)
> provides similar features under the `LGPL` licence but is focused on 
> the `generic` interface.

> The `ExternalBehaviourDescription` reads general information about the
