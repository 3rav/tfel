The @PredictionPolicy keyword let the user how the initial estimate of
the solution shall be obtained.

This keyword is followed by a string. The following values are
allowed:
- NoPrediction
- LinearPrediction
- ElasticPrediction
- ElasticPredictionFromMaterialProperties
- SecantPrediction
- TangentPrediction

Note:
The ElasticPredictionFromMaterialProperties policy is only supported
by the UMAT interface as the Cast3M finite element solver requires the
stiffness matrix to be defined.

Exemple:
@PredictionPolicy 'ElasticPrediction';
