 * The TFEL project provides:
 * - mfront               : a code generator for material properties,
 *   mechanical behaviours and simple models.
 * - TFEL/Math            : a set of classes used in mechanical
 *   implementations of mechanical behaviours and various algorithms.
 *   Mechanical operations are handled using expression templates.
 * - TFEL/Material        : classes used by mechanical behaviours
 * - TFEL/Utilities       : various classes
 * - TFEL/Metaprogramming : a set of classes to ease metaprogramming in C++98
 * - TFEL/Typetraits      : a set of classes providing information on types
 * - TFEL/System          : intefaces to system specific operations on file and
 *                          processes
