\section{Usage of libraries generated using MFront}

The mechanisms used by \abaqus{} to incorporate external subroutines
is not suitable for mechanical behaviours generated by \mfront{}.

We propose a solution which is meant to be flexible and easy to set up
for the end-user.

This solution is based on a~:
\begin{itemize}
\item a generic {\tt umat} subroutine which aims at loading
  dynamically libraries generated by \mfront{}.
\item a naming convention of the material behaviour in the \abaqus{}
  input file which allow the user to specify both the function to
  called and the library in which this function is implemented.
\end{itemize}

This approach allows the user to build \mfront{} libraries {\em before
  the computations}. Those libraries can be shared among various
computations by setting the appropriate environment
variable\footnote{{\tt LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} under {\tt Unix} systems,
  {\tt PATH} under {\tt Windows} systems}.

\subsection{A generic {\tt umat} subroutine}

A generic {\tt umat} subroutine is delivered with \mfront{}. It is
implemented in a file called {\tt umat.cpp}.

The aim of this subroutine is to dynamically load libraries generated
by \mfront{} using the name given to the behaviour in the input
file. This subroutine can with little modifications (under comments in
the source file) be made compatible with other user subroutines so
mixing \og~standard umat~\fg{} implementations and \mfront{}
implementations shall be feasible.

We must insist~: {\em this file is the only source that must be
  compiled along with \abaqus{}~: generation of \mfront{} libraries is
  a different process that is done independently}.

As such, {\tt abaqus} shall be called like this~:
\begin{center}
  {\tt abaqus user=umat.cpp [options] inputfile.inp}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Setting the compiler flags}

The generic {\tt umat} subroutine is written using the {\tt C++-11}
standard. Depending on the compiler and compiler version, appropriate
flags shall be added for the compilation. Those flags are defined in
the {\tt abaqus\_v6.env} file that can be overridden by the user.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \lstinputlisting[language=python]{@abs_top_srcdir@/docs/mfront/abaqus/img/abaqus_v6.env}
  \caption{Declaration of the {\tt C++} compiler flags for {\tt gcc}
    under {\tt LiNuX} in the {\tt abaqus\_v6.env} file. The {\tt
      -{}-{}std=c++11} flag was added at Line~11.}
  \label{fig:abaqus_v6.env}
\end{figure}

For {\tt gcc}, one have to add the {\tt -{}-{}std=c++11} flag. The
modification made to the {\tt abaqus\_v6.env} are reported on
Figure~\ref{fig:abaqus_v6.env} in this case.

\subsection{Name of the behaviour in the Abaqus input file}

The name of the behaviour shall define the function to be called and
the library in which this function is implemented.  It is important to
notice that the name of the behaviour is automatically converted to
upper-case by \abaqus{}.

The name of the libraries generated by \mfront{} though the \abaqus{}
interface are thus upper-cased. {\em The user shall thus be aware that
  he/she must not rename \mfront{} generated libraries using
  lower-case letters.}

By convention, this name is splitted into two parts, separed by the
underscore character ({\tt '\_'}). The first part is the name of
library, without prefix ({\tt lib}) or suffix ({\tt .dll} or {\tt
  .so}). {\tt This convention implies that the library name does not
  contain an underscore character.}

For example, on {\tt UNIX} systems, if one want to call the {\tt
  ELASTICITY} behaviour in {\tt libABAQUSBEHAVIOURS.so} library, the
name of the behaviour in the \abaqus{} input file has to be: {\tt
  ABAQUSBEHAVIOURS\_ELASTICITY}. This leads to the following
declaration of the material:
\begin{flushleft}
{\tt *Material, name=ABAQUSBEHAVIOURS\_ELASTICITY}
\end{flushleft}

\section{Description of the interface functionalities}

\subsection{Supported modelling hypothesis}

\subsection{Setting the out-of-bounds policy}

\subsection{Setting parameters values}

The values of the parameters can be set in an external text file which
is automatically read. If the behaviour name is {\tt Norton}, the name
of this file must be {\tt Norton-\-parameters.txt}.  This file must be
in the current directory.

The parameters file must be formatted like this~:
\begin{flushleft}
  {\tt ParameterName      ParameterValue}\\
  {\tt OtherParameterName OtherParameterValue}\\
  {\tt ...                ...}  
\end{flushleft}

If a parameter is omitted, this parameter will have its default value.

\section{Definition of the consistent tangent operator for finite
  strain behaviours}

\abaqus{} expresses the equilibrium in the rotated frame. To our
current knowledge, the derivation of the consistent tangent operator
\(\tenseurq{C}\) is not described in any reference and the expression
defined in the \abaqus{} manuel differs from the one given in the book
of \nom{Belytschko} et al.~\cite{belytschko_nonlinear_2000}.

More precisely, the consistent tangent operator \(\tenseurq{C}\) is
the tangent moduli associated with the \nom{Jauman} rate of the
\nom{Kirchhoff} stress \(\tenseurq{C}^{J\,\tau}\) divided by \(J\):
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:CJt}
  J\,\tenseurq{C}\,\colon\,\tenseur{D}=\tenseurq{C}^{J\,\tau}\,\colon\,\tenseur{D}=\tenseur{\dot{\tau}}-\tns{W}\,.\,\tenseur{\tau}+\tenseur{\tau}\,.\,\tns{W}  
\end{equation}
where~:
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.8\linewidth}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \(J\) is the determinant of the deformation gradient~;
  \item \(\tenseur{D}\) is the strain rate~;
  \item \(\tns{W}\) is the spin rate, defined as the unsymmetric part
    of the velocity gradient \(\tns{L}\) (defined below):
    \[\tns{W}_{ij}=\Frac{1}{2}\paren{L_{ij}-L_{ji}}\]
  \item \(\tenseur{\tau}\) is the Kirchhoff stress tensor~;
  \item \(\tenseur{\sigma}\) is the Cauchy stress tensor.
  \end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

The velocity gradient is defined by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:L}
  \tns{L}=\dot{\tns{F}}\,.\,\tns{F}^{-1}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Incremental resolutions}

Equation~\eqref{eq:CJt} gives the expression of the consistent tangent
operator \(\tenseurq{C}\) in terms of rates. This is not of much help
in incremental resolutions. Multiplying Equation~\eqref{eq:CJt} by the
time increment \(\Delta\,t\) leads to:
\[
J\,\tenseurq{C}\,\colon\,\Delta\,t\,\tenseur{D}=\Delta\,\tenseur{\tau}-\Delta\,t\,\tns{W}\,.\,\tenseur{\tau}+\tenseur{\tau}\,.\,\Delta\,t\,\tns{W}  
\]

This equation is far from being well defined. Indeed, an assumption
must be made to define the velocity gradient \(\tns{L}\) (and the spin
rate \(\tns{W}\). Moreover, the instant when \(J\) is evaluated must
be precised.

Let us introduce the following definitions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\bts{F}\) is the deformation gradient at the beginning of the time step~;
\item \(\ets{F}\) is the deformation gradient at the end of the time step~;
\item \(\Delta\,t\) is the time increment~;
\item  \(\theta\) is a parameter between \(0\) and \(1\):
\end{itemize}

An approximation of \(\tns{L}\) can be given by~:
\[
\Delta\,t\,\tns{L}=\paren{\ets{\tns{F}}-\bts{\tns{F}}}\,.\,\paren{\bts{\tns{F}}+\theta\,\paren{\ets{\tns{F}}-\bts{\tns{F}}}}^{-1}=\paren{\ets{\tns{F}}-\bts{\tns{F}}}\,.\,\mts{\tns{F}}^{-1}
\]
